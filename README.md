Guide to operate in the APP
1. Run the app by clicking on the run button to activate the emulator
2. The User Interface should presented describing the logo of the app, the name of the app, the name and surname of the student, the student number of the student, and a button to navigate to the next screen
3. On the following screen, it is describing 7 textboxes, which can be used to introduced the temperatures, a button that when pressed calculates the average of the temperatures, and another button that navigates to next screen
4. The following screen it is supposed to display the days of the week, the weather condition on those days, the max and min temperature but because I ran out of time I couldn't code it out. Also this UI contains a button that takes back to the Main Screen
5. The reason i provided screenshots of the app not running it is because the emulator was really slow
